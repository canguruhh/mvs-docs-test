At the Metaverse Genesis there was only Entropy. It has since been increasing with every block and is the fabric that forms everything in the Metaverse. It is needed for the creation of Assets and Avatars as well as for all other interactions that happens within the Metaverse.

Most Avatars simply refer to Entropy as ETP. It is a scarce resource and there are hordes of miners dedicating their hardware to the search for new Entropy. In order to protect the Metaverse there is a elite group of Master Nodes who are competing for the votes of the Entropy holders.
