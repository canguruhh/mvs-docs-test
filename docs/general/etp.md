At the Metaverse Genesis there was only Entropy. It is increasing with every block and is the fabric that forms everything in the Metaverse. It is needed for the creation of Assets and Avatars as well as for all other interactions that happen within the Metaverse.

Most Avatars simply refer to Entropy as ETP. It is a scarce resource and there are hordes of miners who dedicated their hardware to the search for new Entropy.
